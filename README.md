# Intelligent-design-script-of-motor-based-on-python-and-Taguchi-method
Intelligent design script of motor based on python and Taguchi method, currently support BLDC
You can read the "Intelligent design script of permanent magnet brushless motor based on python and Taguchi method" to about how this project start.
this project use python to automation the optimization of the motor FEM calculation, using the interfaces of minitab and motor-cad.
the next developing version is to replace the commercial software with the open souce softwares and support other type of motor such as PMSM, DCM, ACM and so on.
I am currently busy in other stuff and if you find this is useful you can support this project by all means available.
